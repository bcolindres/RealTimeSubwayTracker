# Real Time Subway Tracker
The "Real Time Subway Tracker" exercise incorporates HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and APIs to display real-time locations of Boston's subway system using the MBTA API.

# Overview
This project extends the concept of a "bus tracker" by utilizing the MBTA API to provide real-time information about the locations of all active subways within Boston. By leveraging HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API integration, this exercise displays images representing subway locations, giving a personalized touch to the application.

# Features
MBTA API Integration: Utilizes the MBTA API to fetch real-time subway location data.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Used to create an interactive display of subway locations on a map.

# Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Fork this repository or download it to your machine.
Open the project in your preferred code editor.
Run a live server to view the HTML file in a browser.
Usage
Open the HTML file in a web browser to view the real-time locations of Boston's subway system. The application will display images representing the current locations of active subways, providing an engaging visual representation.

# Roadmap of Future Improvements
What I plan on doing next to improve upon this project is add ferries to this map. Adding ferries will be an interesting addition to this project given we will be able to take into account the ports surrounding Boston along with the bodies of water as well. For this I will need to do some research on what specific API I can use to fetch all the data pertaining to ferries within Boston.
